    Welcome to <strong>skd</strong>, the simple SSH public key distribution software.

    With skd it is easy to control the public keys in your environment,
    granting users the access to hosts they only should have access to.

    It binds keys to users, users to groups and groups to a group of hosts.

    So the "DMZ"-Admin group has the full access to all hosts in the DMZ. And
    any new user only needs to be set up and added to the DMZ-Group to auto-
    matically have all access.

    And revoking access is also as simple as removing the user from a group
    or deleting the user as a whole.

    The public key of the user running <strong>skd</strong> is copied to the
    <em>authorized_keys</em>-file on a newly created machine after a first
    password-based authentication. So the private key of that user needs to
    be highly secure. But even if the key is corrupt, <strong>skd</strong> is able to
    generate a new key, transport that key and remove the old key from the
    systems.

    Choose one of the menu entries on the left.
