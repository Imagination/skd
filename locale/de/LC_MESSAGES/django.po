"      Welcome to <b>skd</b>, the simple SSH public key distribution "
"software.\n"
"\n"
"      With skd it is easy to control the public keys in your environment,\n"
"      granting users the access to hosts they only should have access to.\n"
"\n"
"      It binds keys to users, users to groups and groups to a group of "
"hosts.\n"
"\n"
"      So the \"DMZ\"-Admin group has the full access to all hosts in the "
"DMZ. And\n"
"      any new user only needs to be set up and added to the DMZ-Group to "
"auto-\n"
"      matically have all access.\n"
"\n"
"      And revoking access is also as simple as removing the user from a "
"group\n"
"      or deleting the user as a whole.\n"
"\n"
"      The public key of the user running <b>skd</b> is copied to the\n"
"      <i>authorized_keys</i>-file on a newly created machine after a first\n"
"      password-based authentication. So the private key of that user needs "
"to\n"
"      be highly secure. But even if the key is corrupt, <b>skd</b> is able "
"to\n"
"      generate a new key, transport that key and remove the old key from "
"the\n"
"      systems.\n"
